# hello-world
Practice repository to get myself reacquainted with Github (via https://guides.github.com/activities/hello-world/)

Adding a little about myself to practice branch commits

I am participating to the #100daysofcode challenge, which is perfect timing for me.  I've been wanting to start building a project portfolio but didn't know where to start.  This challenge, along with the community, is exactly what I need right now. 

Happy New Year!
