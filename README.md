# hello-world
Practice repository to get myself reacquainted with Github (via https://guides.github.com/activities/hello-world/)

Adding a little about myself to practice branch commits

I have decided to participate in the #100daysofcode challenge.  
I've been wanting to start building a project portfolio but didn't know where to start.  
This challenge, along with guidance of the creator, along with community, is exactly what I need right now. 
Thanks, Alexander Kallaway and freecodecamp.com!

Happy New Year!
